# ModellingRegulatorsFOXP3

## Credits

The matlab code present in this directory has been written by Stefano Magni, Rucha Sawlekar and Laurent Mombaerts. It is based on scientific work performed by Stefano Magni, Rucha Sawlekar, Jorge Goncalves, Laurent Mombaerts, Zuogong Yue, Feng He, Christophe Capelle, Ye Yuan, Alexandre Baron and Ni Zeng, which can be found in a manuscript soon to be appearing on biorXiv and titled "causal dynamical modelling predicts novel regulatory genes of FOXP3 in human regulatory T cells". 


## What is it?

This code represent the implementation of our method for dynamically modelling gene regulations between genes for which time series microarray data are available. This code was used to generate the ranking of genes as potential regulators of FOXP3, and all the other results (plus additional ones) described in the above mentioned manuscript, which we suggest to read in order to understand the scientific content of this code.


## How to run the code

To run our code:

1. Download the full content of the directory containing this README file.
2. Make sure you have installed Matlab (we developed the code under version 2016b, so we suggest this or subsequent versions).
3. Open Matlab.
4. Select the script corresponding to the analysis you are interested in running, and run it.
