abstract = { The immune system has evolved to mount an effective defense against pathogens and to minimize deleterious immune-mediated inflammation caused by commensal microorganisms, immune responses against self and environmental antigens, and metabolic inflammatory disorders. Regulatory T (Treg) cell–mediated suppression serves as a vital mechanism of negative regulation of immune-mediated inflammation and features prominently in autoimmune and autoinflammatory disorders, allergy, acute and chronic infections, cancer, and metabolic inflammation. The discovery that Foxp3 is the transcription factor that specifies the Treg cell lineage facilitated recent progress in understanding the biology of regulatory T cells. In this review, we discuss cellular and molecular mechanisms in the differentiation and function of these cells. }

  abstract = { AbstractThe immune system has evolved mechanisms to recognize and eliminate threats, as well as to protect against self-destruction. Tolerance to self-antigens is generated through two fundamental mechanisms: (a) elimination of self-reactive cells in the thymus during selection and (b) generation of a variety of peripheral regulatory cells to control self-reactive cells that escape the thymus. It is becoming increasing apparent that a population of thymically derived CD4+ regulatory T cells, exemplified by the expression of the IL-2Rα chain, is essential for the maintenance of peripheral tolerance. Recent work has shown that the forkhead family transcription factor Foxp3 is critically important for the development and function of the regulatory T cells. Lack of Foxp3 leads to development of fatal autoimmune lymphoproliferative disease; furthermore, ectopic Foxp3 expression can phenotypically convert effector T cells to regulatory T cells. This review focuses on Foxp3 expression and function and highlights differences between humans and mice regarding Foxp3 regulation. }

abstract = "Summary
Regulatory T (Treg) cells suppress inflammatory immune responses and autoimmunity caused by self-reactive T cells. The key Treg cell transcription factor Foxp3 is downregulated during inflammation to allow for the acquisition of effector T cell-like functions. Here, we demonstrate that stress signals elicited by proinflammatory cytokines and lipopolysaccharides lead to the degradation of Foxp3 through the action of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Stub1. Stub1 interacted with Foxp3 to promote its K48-linked polyubiquitination in an Hsp70-dependent manner. Knockdown of endogenous Stub1 or Hsp70 prevented Foxp3 degradation. Furthermore, the overexpression of Stub1 in Treg cells abrogated their ability to suppress inflammatory immune responses in vitro and in vivo and conferred a T-helper-1-cell-like phenotype. Our results demonstrate the critical role of the stress-activated Stub1-Hsp70 complex in promoting Treg cell inactivation, thus providing a potential therapeutic target for the intervention against autoimmune disease, infection, and cancer."

	abstract = {Treg cells suppress excessive and aberrant immune responses. Impaired function or homeostasis of Treg cells would induce severe autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Forkhead box P3 (FOXP3), as a master regulator of Treg cells, forms a large complex with other binding factors to modulate Treg-cell function subtly in pathological and physiological conditions. We identified that Deleted in breast cancer 1 (DBC1) is an essential subunit of the FOXP3 complex in human CD4+ Treg cells. Our results show that the inflammatory cytokines TNF-α or IL-6 trigger FOXP3 degradation, whereas downregulation of DBC1 expression prevents FOXP3 degradation and maintains Treg-cell function under inflammatory stimuli in vitro and in vivo. These findings unveil a previously unidentified pathway for therapeutically modulating FOXP3+ Treg-cell stability under inflammation.Forkhead box P3 (FOXP3)-positive Treg cells are crucial for maintaining immune homeostasis. FOXP3 cooperates with its binding partners to elicit Treg cells{\textquoteright} signature and function, but the molecular mechanisms underlying the modulation of the FOXP3 complex remain unclear. Here we report that Deleted in breast cancer 1 (DBC1) is a key subunit of the FOXP3 complex. We found that DBC1 interacts physically with FOXP3, and depletion of DBC1 attenuates FOXP3 degradation in inflammatory conditions. Treg cells from Dbc1-deficient mice were more resistant to inflammation-mediated abrogation of Foxp3 expression and function and delayed the onset and severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and colitis in mice. These findings establish a previously unidentified mechanism regulating FOXP3 stability during inflammation and reveal a pathway for potential therapeutic modulation and intervention in inflammatory diseases.},

	abstract = {Regulatory T cells play important roles in the control of autoimmunity and maintenance of transplantation tolerance. Foxp3, a member of the forkhead/winged-helix family of transcription factors, acts as the master regulator for regulatory T-cell (Treg) development and function. Mutation of the Foxp3 gene causes the scurfy phenotype in mouse and IPEX syndrome (immune dysfunction, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked syndrome) in humans. Epigenetics is defined by regulation of gene expression without altering nucleotide sequence in the genome. Several epigenetic markers, such as histone acetylation and methylation, and cytosine residue methylation in CpG dinucleotides, have been reported at the Foxp3 locus. In particular, CpG dinucleotides at the Foxp3 locus are methylated in naive CD4+CD25- T cells, activated CD4+ T cells, and TGF-β{\textendash}induced adaptive Tregs, whereas they are completely demethylated in natural Tregs. The DNA methyltransferases DNMT1 and DNMT3b are associated with the Foxp3 locus in CD4+ T cells. Methylation of CpG residues represses Foxp3 expression, whereas complete demethylation is required for stable Foxp3 expression. In this review, we discuss how different cis-regulatory elements at the Foxp3 locus are subjected to epigenetic modification in different subsets of CD4+ T cells and regulate Foxp3 expression, and how these mechanisms can be exploited to generate efficiently large numbers of suppressive Tregs for therapeutic purposes.},

We investigated the dynamical response of the Arabidopsis thaliana circadian network to nicotinamide, a metabolite that lengthens the period of circadian rhythms, to uncover key transcriptional mechanisms required for the adjustment of daily biological activity. The identification of the mechanisms of drug response is challenging, as a complex cascading effect causes large section of the transcriptome to be differentially expressed, despite not being directly affected by the drug. To identify the source of the change in circadian period, we introduce a modelling strategy based on the identification and comparison of gene regulatory dynamics before and after the perturbation occurred. The Dynamical Differential Expression (DyDE) methodology uses a reverse engineering approach that favours both the identification of unknown Gene Regulatory Network (GRN) topology and the interpretation of the possible dynamical changes, without the need to cover extensive experiments or to make prior assumptions of network dynamics. Subsequently, we show that our methodology can reliably identify the source of a perturbation in complex regulatory systems such as the circadian network. The proposed mathematical framework is scalable and flexible, so that it can be applied to large datasets with scarce sampling.},

Here, we describe a powerful analytical method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for interpreting gene expression data. The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.},

Dissecting the molecular mechanisms by which T helper (Th) cells differentiate to effector Th2 cells is important for understanding the pathogenesis of immune-mediated diseases, such as asthma and allergy. Because the STAT6 transcription factor is an upstream mediator required for interleukin-4 (IL-4)-induced Th2 cell differentiation, its targets include genes important for this process. Using primary human CD4+ T cells, and by blocking STAT6 with RNAi, we identified a number of direct and indirect targets of STAT6 with ChIP sequencing. The integration of these data sets with detailed kinetics of IL-4-driven transcriptional changes showed that STAT6 was predominantly needed for the activation of transcription leading to the Th2 cell phenotype. This integrated genome-wide data on IL-4- and STAT6-mediated transcription provide a unique resource for studies on Th cell differentiation and, in particular, for designing interventions of human Th2 cell responses."

Recently, it was shown that the transcription factor FOXP3 is necessary and sufficient for the generation of CD4+CD25+ Tregs in mice. We investigated the capacity of FOXP3 to drive the generation of suppressive CD4+CD25+ Tregs in humans. Surprisingly, although ectopic expression of FOXP3 in human CD4+ T cells resulted in induction of hyporesponsiveness and suppression of IL-2 production, it did not lead to acquisition of significant suppressor activity in vitro. Similarly, ectopic expression of FOXP3Δ2, an isoform found in human CD4+CD25+ Tregs that lacks exon 2, also failed to induce the development of suppressor T cells. Moreover, when FOXP3 and FOXP3Δ2 were simultaneously overexpressed, although the expression of several Treg-associated cell surface markers was significantly increased, only a modest suppressive activity was induced. These data indicate that in humans, overexpression of FOXP3 alone or together with FOXP3Δ2 is not an effective method to generate potent suppressor T cells in vitro and suggest that factors in addition to FOXP3 are required during the process of activation and/or differentiation for the development of bona fide Tregs.},

          literature into online databases are expanding. Hence, there is a wealth of information
          about genes, proteins and their associations, with an urgent need for data integration to
          achieve better knowledge extraction and data reuse. For this purpose, we developed the
          Harmonizome: a collection of processed datasets gathered to serve and mine knowledge about
          genes and proteins from over 70 major online resources. We extracted, abstracted and
          organized data into âˆ¼72 million functional associations between genes/proteins and their
          attributes. Such attributes could be physical relationships with other biomolecules,
          expression in cell lines and tissues, genetic associations with knockout mouse or human
          phenotypes, or changes in expression after drug treatment. We stored these associations in
          a relational database along with rich metadata for the genes/proteins, their attributes
          and the original resources. The freely available Harmonizome web portal provides a
          graphical user interface, a web service and a mobile app for querying, browsing and
          downloading all of the collected data. To demonstrate the utility of the Harmonizome, we
          computed and visualized geneâ€“gene and attributeâ€“attribute similarity networks, and through
          unsupervised clustering, identified many unexpected relationships by combining pairs of
          datasets such as the association between kinase perturbations and disease signatures. We
          also applied supervised machine learning methods to predict novel substrates for kinases,
          endogenous ligands for G-protein coupled receptors, mouse phenotypes for knockout genes,
          and classified unannotated transmembrane proteins for likelihood of being ion channels.
          The Harmonizome is a comprehensive resource of knowledge about genes and proteins, and as

abstract = "The incidence of autoimmune pathologies is increasing worldwide. This has stimulated interest on their etiopathogenesis, caused by a complex interaction of genetic and environmental factors. With the advent of genome-wide linkage, candidate gene and genome wide association studies, risk polymorphisms in autophagy-related genes were discovered in several autoimmune conditions suggesting the possible contribution of autophagy to their etiopathogenesis. Autophagy represents the principal catabolic process mediated by lysosomes used by eukaryotic cells and is strictly regulated by proteins belonging to the Atg family. The function of autophagy has been well characterized in various tissues and systems, but its role in the regulation of innate and adaptive immune systems has been only recently discovered. It plays a fundamental role in the modulation of thymocyte selection and in the generation of T lymphocyte repertoire by participating in the intracellular antigen presentation on MHC class-II molecules by thymic epithelial cells. Furthermore, the generation of mice with knockout for specific autophagy-related genes induced several immunological alterations, including defects in B and T cell compartments and in T cell activation. In this review we report recent evidence on the role of autophagy in autoimmunity and discuss its relevance to the pathogenesis of these diseases. We finally highlight that future research may disclose potential new therapeutic targets for the treatment of this category of disorders by modulating the autophagic pathway."

In chronic infectious diseases, Tregs dampen inflammation to limit tissue damage, but they can also inhibit ensuing effector immunity, thereby impairing pathogen clearance. Chronic persistent infections by human pathogens such as parasites, viruses, and (myco)bacteria can all result in the induction of both CD4+ and CD8+ Tregs. However, among the many different subsets of Tregs that are induced, mostly CD4+ Tregs have been studied. A remarkably increased frequency has been observed at the site of infection, supporting a role in pathogen containment. Indeed, antigen specificity has been demonstrated for several pathogen derived antigens. Here we review different classes of human Tregs in infectious diseases, including CD4 and CD8 Treg subsets. A better understanding of the induction and activity of Tregs is relevant for the design of better vaccines that optimally induce effector immunity without co-induction of excessive Treg activity."

Therefore, equilibrium in the Treg number and function is important to ensure pathogen clearance and protection from infection-associated immunopathologies. Recent advances in understanding of Treg influence on the outcome of infection opened new avenues to target them. Various small molecules, pharmacological inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies that target Tregs provided proof of concept in experimental models. The field also benefits from advances in other subjects, particularly oncology and autoimmunity, where Treg-targeted therapies are exploited in the clinic to a greater extent. The future research should aim at translating this preclinical success to human application.},

abstract = {Abstract A sustained neuroinflammatory response is the hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, and HIV-associated neurodegeneration. A specific subset of T cells, currently recognized as FOXP3+CD25+CD4+ regulatory T cells (Tregs), are pivotal in suppressing autoimmunity and maintaining immune homeostasis by mediating self-tolerance at the periphery as shown in autoimmune diseases and cancers. A growing body of evidence shows that Tregs are not only important for maintaining immune balance at the periphery but also contribute to self-tolerance and immune privilege in the central nervous system. In this article, we first review the current status of knowledge concerning the development and the suppressive function of Tregs. We then discuss the evidence supporting a dysfunction of Tregs in several neurodegenerative diseases. Interestingly, a dysfunction of Tregs is mainly observed in the early stages of several neurodegenerative diseases, but not in their chronic stages, pointing to a causative role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, we provide an overview of a number of molecules, such as hormones, neuropeptides, neurotransmitters, or ion channels, that affect the dysfunction of Tregs in neurodegenerative diseases. We also emphasize the effects of the intestinal microbiome on the induction and function of Tregs and the need to study the crosstalk between the enteric nervous system and Tregs in neurodegenerative diseases. Finally, we point out the need for a systems biology approach in the analysis of the enormous complexity regulating the function of Tregs and their potential role in neurodegenerative diseases.

However, as temporal information is lost with such data, mathematical models have been limited to capture only static features of the underlying cellular mechanisms.Results: Here, we present a modular framework which allows to recover the temporal behaviour from single-cell snapshot data and reverse engineer the dynamics of gene expression. The framework combines a dimensionality reduction method with a cell time-ordering algorithm to generate pseudo time-series observations. These are in turn used to learn transcriptional ODE models and do model selection on structural network features. We apply it on synthetic data and then on real hematopoietic stem cells data, to reconstruct gene expression dynamics during differentiation pathways and infer the structure of a key gene regulatory network.Availability and implementation: C++ and Matlab code available at https://www.helmholtz-muenchen.de/fileadmin/ICB/software/inferenceSnapshot.zip.Contact:fabian.theis@helmholtz-muenchen.deSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",

title = "NRBF2 regulates autophagy and prevents liver injury by modulating Atg14L-linked phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase III activity",
abstract = "The Beclin 1-Vps34 complex, the core component of the class III phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K-III), binds Atg14L or UVRAG to control different steps of autophagy. However, the mechanism underlying the control of PI3K-III activity remains elusive. Here we report the identification of NRBF2 as a component in the specific PI3K-III complex and a modulator of PI3K-III activity. Through its microtubule interaction and trafficking (MIT) domain, NRBF2 binds Atg14L directly and enhances Atg14L-linked Vps34 kinase activity and autophagy induction. NRBF2-deficient cells exhibit enhanced vulnerability to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress that is reversed by re-introducing exogenous NRBF2. NRBF2-deficient mice develop focal liver necrosis and ductular reaction, accompanied by impaired Atg14L-linked Vps34 activity and autophagy, although the mice show no increased mortality. Our data reveal a key role for NRBF2 in the assembly of the specific Atg14L-Beclin 1-Vps34-Vps15 complex for autophagy induction. Thus, NRBF2 modulates autophagy via regulation of PI3K-III and prevents ER stress-mediated cytotoxicity and liver injury.",

	abstract = {The transcription factor FOXP3 is essential for the formation and function of regulatory T cells (Tregs), and Tregs are essential for maintaining immune homeostasis and tolerance. This is demonstrated by a lethal autoimmune defect in mice lacking Foxp3 and in immunodysregulation polyendocrinopathy enteropathy X-linked syndrome patients. However, little is known about the molecular basis of human FOXP3 function or the relationship between direct and indirect targets of FOXP3 in human Tregs. To investigate this, we have performed a comprehensive genome-wide analysis for human FOXP3 target genes from cord blood Tregs using chromatin immunoprecipitation array profiling and expression profiling. We have identified 5579 human FOXP3 target genes and derived a core Treg gene signature conserved across species using mouse chromatin immunoprecipitation data sets. A total of 739 of the 5579 FOXP3 target genes were differentially regulated in Tregs compared with Th cells, thus allowing the identification of a number of pathways and biological functions overrepresented in Tregs. We have identified gene families including cell surface molecules and microRNAs that are differentially expressed in FOXP3+ Tregs. In particular, we have identified a novel role for peptidase inhibitor 16, which is expressed on the cell surface of \&gt;80\% of resting human CD25+FOXP3+ Tregs, suggesting that in conjunction with CD25 peptidase inhibitor 16 may be a surrogate surface marker for Tregs with potential clinical application.},

	abstract = {The circadian clock is a complex transcriptional network that regulates gene expression in anticipation of the day-night cycle and controls agronomic traits in plants. However, in crops, information on the effects of the internal clock and day-night cues on the transcriptome is limited. We analysed the diel and circadian leaf transcriptomes in the barley cultivar Bowman and derived introgression lines carrying mutations in EARLY FLOWERING 3 (ELF3), LUX1, and EARLY MATURITY 7 (EAM7). Mutations in ELF3 and LUX1 abolished circadian transcriptome oscillations under constant conditions, whereas eam7 maintained oscillations of â30\% of the circadian transcriptome. However, day-night cues fully restored transcript oscillations in all three mutants and thus compensated for a disrupted oscillator in the arrhythmic barley clock mutants elf3 and lux1. Nevertheless, elf3 but not lux1 affected the phase of the diel oscillating transcriptome and thus the integration of external cues into the clock. Using dynamical modelling, we predicted a structure of the barley circadian oscillator and interactions of its individual components with day-night cues. Our findings provide a valuable resource for exploring the function and output targets of the circadian clock and for further investigations into the diel and circadian control of the barley transcriptome.},

abstract = "In the past years, many computational methods have been developed to infer the structure of gene regulatory networks from time series data. However, the applicability and accuracy presumptions of such algorithms remain unclear due to experimental heterogeneity. This paper assesses the performance of recent and successful network inference strategies under a novel, multifactorial evaluation framework in order to highlight pragmatic tradeoffs in experimental design. The effects of data quantity and systems perturbations are addressed, thereby formulating guidelines for efficient resource management. Realistic data were generated from six widely used benchmark models of rhythmic and non-rhythmic gene regulatory systems with random perturbations mimicking the effect of gene knock-out or chemical treatments. Then, time series data of increasing lengths were provided to five state-of-the-art network inference algorithms representing distinctive mathematical paradigms. The performances of such network reconstruction methodologies are uncovered under various experimental conditions. We report that the algorithms do not benefit equally from data increments. Furthermore, at least for the studied rhythmic system, it is more profitable for network inference strategies to be run on long time series rather than short time series with multiple perturbations. By contrast, for the non-rhythmic systems, increasing the number of perturbation experiments yielded better results than increasing the sampling frequency. We expect that future benchmark and algorithm design would integrate such multifactorial considerations to promote their widespread and conscientious usage."

	abstract = {Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) is the gatekeeper enzyme into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Here we show that PARK7/DJ-1, a key familial Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease (PD) gene, is a pacemaker controlling PDH activity in CD4 regulatory T cells (Tregs). DJ-1 bound to PDH-E1 beta (PDHB), inhibiting the phosphorylation of PDH-E1 alpha (PDHA), thus promoting PDH activity and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Dj-1 depletion impaired Treg proliferation and cellularity maintenance in older mice, increasing the severity during the remission phase of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). The compromised proliferation and differentiation of Tregs in Dj-1 knockout mice were caused via regulating PDH activity. These findings provide novel insight into the already complicated regulatory machinery of the PDH complex and demonstrate that the DJ-1-PDHB axis represents a potent target to maintain Treg homeostasis, which is dysregulated in many complex diseases.},
